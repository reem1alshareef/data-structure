# data-structure

the project idea involves applying the Weighted Common Neighbors (WCN) algorithm in Java to recommend friends in a social network. The WCN algorithm assigns weights to the common neighbors between two nodes based on their degrees, and is often used in social network analysis to suggest potential friends or collaborators for a given user.

The recommendWCN method takes a graph, a user ID, and an integer k, and returns the top k recommended friends for the given user based on their WCN scores. If the user does not exist in the graph, the method returns null.

the code also includes a generic Set interface that provides methods to insert, remove, search, and iterate over elements in a set.

Overall,  the general idea is about implementing graph algorithms and data structures in Java, that could be useful for social network analysis or recommendation systems.
