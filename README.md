# data-structure

the project idea involves implementing and applying graph algorithms in Java. The main method recommendWCN takes a graph g, a user ID i, and an integer k as input, and returns the top k recommended friends for the given user i using the weighted common neighbors method.

The Graph class appears to be a generic graph data structure that supports operations such as adding and removing nodes and edges, and querying the neighbors and degree of a node. The Set interface is also included, providing a generic set data structure with methods to insert, remove, and search for elements, as well as iterate over the elements in ascending or descending order.

Overall, my project involve implementing graph algorithms and data structures in Java, and using them to solve problems such as recommending friends in social networks.
